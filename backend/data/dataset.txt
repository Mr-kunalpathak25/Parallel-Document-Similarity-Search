The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A collection of papers on distributed computing and parallel processing.
Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python.
The dog is lazy and sleeps all day near the fox.
Cosine similarity is a measure of geometric distance.

Document 5:
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn by interacting with the environment.
This query document will be used to test the similarity search. I am interested in how search engines work. They usually rely on TF-IDF vectorization to represent the document and the query. Once vectorized, the system calculates the cosine similarity to retrieve and rank the most similar documents quickly and efficiently.
